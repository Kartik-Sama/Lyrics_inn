# Lyrics Inn

In this project we aim to bring the experience of a song and it's lyrics closer.

## Progress

We have used the *Genius API* to retrrive lyrics of a song with it's name as input. For input, if a microphone is detected we can also take input as your voice over typing the song name.

**NOTE:** The *Genius API key* is app specific and is not reproducable in other works. One can always generate their own API key for their app for free, thanks to Genius :smiley:
